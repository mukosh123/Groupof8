Learning Map
It's useful to track personal learning progress when going through any learning program (like boot camp).

In your groups, create a command line program using python 3 to help boot camp participants track their progress using the learning map.

As a user, I would like to be able to add skills, view a list of all the skills added, indicate the skills I've studied, view a list of skills I've studied, view a list of skills I haven't studied yet and see my learning progress.
